# Distributed Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of distributed machine learning pipelines using Apache Spark with MLlib and Dask. The goal is to leverage these technologies to efficiently process large datasets and perform machine learning tasks across multiple servers or nodes, thus enhancing computational efficiency and scalability.

## Objectives

- Utilize Apache Spark and MLlib for large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks.
- Implement Dask to parallelize computation for analytics and machine learning, providing scalability and performance at scale.
- Showcase examples of how to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models using distributed computing resources.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- PySpark
- Dask
- Dask-ML
- XGBoost (for Dask example)
- scikit-learn (optional, for additional ML models and utilities)

## Installation

### Apache Spark

1. Download Apache Spark from the [official website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. Unpack the downloaded tarball (`.tgz` file) and move the Spark directory to a location of your choice.
3. Add Spark's `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pyspark dask distributed dask-ml xgboost
```

## Usage

### Apache Spark with MLlib

Run the Spark example with:

```bash
spark-submit spark_ml_pipeline.py
```

Ensure `spark_ml_pipeline.py` is your Python script containing the Spark MLlib pipeline code.

### Dask

Execute the Dask example by running the Python script:

```bash
python dask_ml_pipeline.py
```

Replace `dask_ml_pipeline.py` with the name of your script containing the Dask pipeline code.

## Examples

The `spark_ml_pipeline.py` script demonstrates a machine learning pipeline with Spark MLlib, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

The `dask_ml_pipeline.py` script showcases how to use Dask and Dask-ML for parallel data processing and machine learning, with an example of training and evaluating an XGBoost classifier.
